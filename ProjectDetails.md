# Summary
This is a simple app I made to test and play with androidâ€™s image animation functionality.\
To see how it works I uploaded a short video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXO6JAi1iu0).\
If you wish to test this app yourself, simply download it into Android Studio and use the android emulator.

## Technical details
For development of the app, I used the java inside of Android Studio IDE.\
To achieve the animation features of this app, I used the android ViewPropertyAnimator functionality.
